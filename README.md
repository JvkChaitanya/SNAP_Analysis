# Food Access Research Project

## Project Overview
This project investigates the 2019 Atlas dataset to explore food access in the United States, with a specific focus on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). The analysis includes demographic distributions, program utilization, and state-level comparisons.

## Dataset
The dataset was obtained from [Data.gov](https://data.gov), an open-source platform maintained by the U.S. government. It contains data generated by various departments, including the USDA, on topics such as food security, nutrition programs, and demographic statistics.

## Notebook Structure
1. **Introduction:** Overview of the research focus and dataset.
2. **Dataset Description:** Details about the data source and its features.
3. **Data Preprocessing:** Steps to clean and prepare the dataset for analysis.
4. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualization and summary statistics to understand patterns in the data.
5. **Statistical Analysis:** Insights into demographic and regional trends in SNAP participation.
6. **Conclusions:** Key findings from the analysis.

## Key Features
- **Data Source:** 2019 Atlas dataset
- **Focus Areas:** Food access, SNAP participation, demographic and geographic disparities
- **Tools Used:** Python, Jupyter Notebook, libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn

## Requirements
To run the notebook, ensure the following dependencies are installed:
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- NumPy
